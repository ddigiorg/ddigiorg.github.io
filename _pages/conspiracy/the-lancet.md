The Lancet [^1] is a weekly peer-reviewed general medical journal. It is among the world's oldest, most prestigious, and best known general medical journals (since 1823).  In 2015 the editor-in-chief, Dr. Richard Horton published a statement declaring that a lot of published research is in fact unreliable at best, if not completely false:

> The case against science is straightforward: much of the scientific literature, perhaps half, may simply be untrue. Afflicted by studies with small sample sizes, tiny effects, invalid exploratory analyses, and flagrant conflicts of interest, together with an obsession for pursuing fashionable trends of dubious importance, science has taken a turn towards darkness. - Dr. Richard Horton [^2]
