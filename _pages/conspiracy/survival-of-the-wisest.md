**TODO: needs updating**

**Author**: Dr. Jonas E. Salk
**Date**: 1972

- Thesis: The elite (scientific class) are the wisest and represent the highest form of evolution and therefore are the arbiters of evolution/nature and should have the powers to decide who lives and dies.  Man will not survive without the scientific priest class.
- Establishment mutates you through RNA viruses, DNA, and experimenting on female eggs (ch. 7, Mutations).  Introduce mass diseases.
- Inoculations can be a means by which they could engineer evolution/devolution by manipulating the genetic code
- Man must take that duty upon himself to regulate nature just like nature regulates (pg. 4 and 5.), man must serve nature
- To accept mass death is to be pro life because nature regulates man’s population by causing death
- We need change agents to indoctrinate man out of the idea of objective truth and moral wrong into the religion of evolution/relativism (pg. 28).
- New values must be inculcated by the scientific elite because they represent nature’s highest form of process (pg. 30)
- Mass viruses might actually propell evolution to create fitter offspring by the possibilities of mass cancer viruses
- Suppress genetic code/potential through scientific means such as an RNA virus and these malfunctions could cause reproductive problems and behavioral disorders (pg. 37) (like Arthur Koestler said at the CIA conference in the 60s in San Fran.).  There’s the possibility through viruses and through injecting these in different ways/forms (pg. 38)... he’s the father of mass inoculation/vaccines and defeating polio
- Darwin metaphysics: life is a mere mutation of chance events, mutation of man/life from non-life is just like big bang from nothing.  Man is a mutant so there’s nothing with science mutating man. (pg. 41, 42)
- We could mutate man by understanding DNA/RNA and experiment with injecting viruses into eggs that female produces and thus create advantageous/disadvantageous effects.  - We could radiate man, use x-rays on tissues, chemicals(pg. 43, 44)
- We could use the arts to teach man evolution
- Nature is guiding man towards survival or extinction.  If we let traditionalists and moralists guide us we will go extinct (from the guy who wants to kill everyone)
- All is flux (pg. 53), which is self-refuting because somehow his position is not flux…
- The fittest are the ones who survive into the future and the wisest are the ones who understand darwinism (scientific priest class...) (pg 53?)
- Re-educate man, death/destruction lead to good things (pg 67)
- The elite must function as the immune system of the planet and the species.  Traditionalists and people who don’t accept darwinism need to be killed or else traditional - values will lead to the extinction of the species. (pg. 70, 72)
- The elite will decide who lives/dies, evolutionists will live (pg. 71)
- The elite will augment nature and become the incarnation of the selection of the survival of the fittest (pg. 74, 75)
- Euthanasia and abortion (pg 77)
- Implement a fake guilt complex that you’re wasteful and need austerity and man is harming the environment.  As a result we will call the pro-lifers pro-death because you’re regressive. (pg. 81)
- Death education (pg. 82) from womb to tomb (pg. 83)
- Arts and religion must be the tools to inculcate the religion of death because there’s such a thing as useful destruction (pg. 84, 85)
- Man is Frankenstein and we can reassemble him (pg. 116)
- Devolution is just as real as evolution and we can engineer it.  It is not the individual, but the race of man that is immortal (like H.G. Wells).  Immortality is the purview of the scientific elite and transhumanists and “the species of the whole but not anyone who’s individual”.  You’re a meaningless cog serving the elite.
Book contains lots of metaphysics
