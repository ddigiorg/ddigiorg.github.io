Founded in 1968, the Club of Rome (NGO) consists of current and former heads of state, UN bureaucrats, high-level politicians and government officials, diplomats, scientists, economists, and business leaders from around the globe [^1].  In their 1991 report, The First Global Revolution [^2], they state:

> Because of the sudden absence of traditional enemies, "new enemies must be identified." - pg. 70

> In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine, and the like would fit the bill.... All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself. - pg. 75
