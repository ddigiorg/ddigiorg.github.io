- **Thesis**: The final conclusion and ultimate point proven by the premises.
- **Valid Argument**: An argument that contains no logical fallacies.
- **Sound Argument**: An argument that is valid and whose premises are true, therefore it is necessary that the conclusion is true.
- **Conversion**: Switch S and P to get an equivalent meaning

- **Syllogism**: The formal structure of a logical argument where two premises lead to a conclusion.
- **Premise**: A proposition that is used as evidence in an argument.
- **Conclusion**: Asserted by the logical result of an argument based on the relationship of the stated premises.

Example:

```
All M are P. (major premise)
All S are M. (minor premise)
All S are P. (conclusion)
```

- `M`: Middle term
- `S`: Subject of the conclusion
- `P`: Predicate of the conclusion
- **Major premise**: Links M with P
- **Minor premise**: Links M with S

## Categorical Propositions or Forms

- **Proposition**: A spoken assertion.
- **Categorical Proposition**: A proposition containing 2 terms, subject and predicate, in which the predicate is either asserted or denied of the subject.

The Four Proposition:

| code | quantifier | subject | copula  | predicate | type                   |
|:-----|:-----------|:--------|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------------------|
| `A`  | All        | S       | are     | P         | universal affirmative  |
| `E`  | No         | S       | are     | P         | universal negative     |
| `I`  | Some       | S       | are     | P         | particular affirmative |
| `O`  | Some       | S       | are not | P         | particular negative    |

- Example A: All dogs are white
- Example E: No dogs are white
- Example I: Some dogs are white
- Example O: Some dogs are not white

## Syllogistic Figures

- **Figure**: in logic a figure is the classification of syllogisms according to the arrangement of the middle term.

|          | Fig1 | Fig2 | Fig3 | Fig4 |
|:---------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Major** | M-P  | P-M  | M-P  | P-M  |
|**Minor** | S-M  | S-M  | M-S  | M-S  |
|**Conc.** | S-P  | S-P  | S-P  | S-P  |
|          | AAA  | EAE  | AII  | AEE  |
|          | EAE  | AEE  | IAI  | IAI  |
|          | AII  | EIO  | EIO  | EIO  |
|          | EIO  | AOO  | OAO  | AEO  |
|          | AAI  | EAO  | EAO  | EAO  |
|          | EAO  | AEO  | AAI  | AAI  |

Examples:

- **AAA**: All dogs are animals.  All animals are living beings.  Therefore, all dogs are living beings.

## Modern Square of Opposition

- **Contradictory**: The truth of one proposition implies the falsity of the other, and conversely(e.g. "all dogs are white" and "not every dog is white")
- **Contrary**: Propositions that cannot both be true (e.g. "every dog is white" and "no dog is white")

- AO/OA: Contradictory (All dogs are white.  Some dogs are not white.)
- EI/IE: Contradictory (No dogs are white.  Some dogs are white.)
- AE/EA: Contrary (All dogs are white. No dogs are white.)
- IO/OI: Subcontrary (Some dogs are white. Some dogs are not white.)
- EO/OE: Subalternation (No dogs are white. Some dogs are not white.)
- AI/IA: Subalternation (All dogs are white. Some dogs are white.)

## Argument

Father Deacon Ananias Sorem

```
A All physical things are particulars (E.G. This pen is a particular pen.  It does not represent the class of all markers.  It's one marker.)
E No universals are particulars
E No universals are physical things
Conversion: No physical things are universals

E No physical things are universals
I Some concepts are universals
O Some concepts are not physical things

O Some concepts are not physical things
A All concepts are in the mind
O Some (things) in the mind are not physical things
Translated: Some things in the mind are not physical

O Some things in the mind are not physical
A All things in the mind are part of the mind
O Some part of the mind is not physical
Translated to I** Some part of the mind is immaterial

**Contradiction** 
- **I** Some part of the mind is not physical
- **E** No part of the mind is immaterial (materialism thesis)
```
