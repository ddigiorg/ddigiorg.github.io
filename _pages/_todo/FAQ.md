### What are the three branches of philosophy?

These branches make up a worldview, our basic lenses of interpretation that form our understanding of the world.  Each branch implies and necessitates the other by entailment.

- **Epistomology**: What's true/false? (knowledge)
- **Ethics**: What's right/wrong? (morals)
- **Metaphysics**: What is/isn't? (ontology)

### What is a syllogism?

### What is a logic?

**TODO: need to complete**

- **The Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC)**: An extension of logic that says a proposition cannot be both true and false.  That is, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.  Aristotle's arguement with the sophists was the LNC can not be made false because to do so would necessarily use the LNC to try to disprove it.

### What is a transendental?

Immaterial, invariant, universal, and interrelated concepts that must exist (necessary preconditions) for the possibility of knowledge or argumentation.  The deniel of these preconditions leads to absurdity because one would be using transcendentals to deny transcendentals which is self-refuting.  Examples include: space, time, the self, mind, causality, meaning (telos), the past, universals, particulars, abstract concepts, induction, identity over time, the one and the many, ethics, numbers, the laws of logic, mathematics, truth, truth over time, etc.

### What is a transcendental argument?

X is a *necessary condition* for the *possibility* of Y; Y; Therefore X.

### What is the Transcendental Argument for God (TAG)?

TAG demonstrates the Christian Triune God as He has revealed Himself to us is only unique precondition that will satisfy all conditions for the possibility of knowledge, logic, rationality, and argumentation.  It is both a presuppositional argument for the Christian worldview and a critique of the presuppositions of other worldviews.

### What is empericism?

Empiricism is a theory that states that "knowledge comes only from sensory experience".

Perennial problems for empiricism include:

- Myth of the given
- Problem of the external world
- Induction 
- Status of immaterial objects 
- No properly basic beliefs 

### What is deductive reasoning?

Deductive reasoning, or "top-down logic", is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logical conclusion.

- If the premises are true you will reach an absolute certain conclusion
- E.g. if A=B and B=C therefore A=C (mathematics, logic)
- Truths we can reach by mere thoughts and reason

### What is inductive reasoning?

Inductive reasoning, or "bottom-up logic", is a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence, but not full assurance, of the truth of the conclusion.

Induction requires the belief that nature is uniform and that the future is like the past.  It is the moving from particular facts in a person's experience to general universal truths which are exhibited by those particular experiences.  For example, children do not merely conclude from their pain that a particular case of flame is burning them.  They usually project that fire in general (all fire) will burn them as well.  The way things happen can be viewed as instances of general laws and what has occured in the past is a reliable guide for predicting what will occur in the future.

- **Uniformity in Nature**: the method of generalizing from observed cases to all (universal) cases of the same kind
- **Past Experience**: If certain events bring about a certain effect today, the same factors will cause a similar effect later
- If the premises are true you will reach a probable conclusion but it is not certain (e.g. black swans)
- Farmer feeds chickens but one day kills them for food
- Probable truths reached through experience and percieving how the world works and reaching conclusions this way

### What is the problem of induction?

With inductive reasoning you can never reach 100% certain knowledge, just probable conclusions based on previous particular experiences.  Thus there is no emperical basis for the universal principle of induction.  By extension, there is no emperical basis for causation or teleology.  Thus every time a skeptic or empericist attempts to argue, he will be utilizing principles that are unjustified on his worldview.  The ability to reason at all requires nature to operate in a regular way (induction) which can not be proven through emperical investigation.  Therefore, it relys on some form of "faith" to justify itself.  In the Christian paradigm the world is operating in a normative regular fasion because of Divine providence.

"...what is the nature of that evidence which assures us of any real existence and matter of fact, beyond the present testimony of our senses, or the records of our memory." -David Hume, 18th century Scottish skeptic

"The inductive principle, however, is equally incapable of being proved by an appeal to experience. Experience might conceivably confirm the inductive principle as regards the cases that have been already examined; but as regards unexamined cases, it is the inductive principle alone that can justify any inference from what has been examined to what has not been examined. All arguments which, on the basis of experience, argue as to the future or the unexperienced parts of the past or present, assume the inductive principle; hence we can never use experience to prove the inductive principle without begging the question." -Bertrand Russell, 20th century English philosopher

### What is Occam's Razor?

"More things should not be used than are necessary."  Occam's razor only applies when the simple explanation and complex explanation both work equally well. If a more complex explanation does a better job than a simpler one, then you should use the complex explanation.  Note: Occam's razor is not a law, foundational principle, or axiom of logic and is more of a guideline or "rule of thumb".

### Why is truth eternal?

Leibniz demonstrates the eternality of truth by demonstrating the statement "Caesar crossed the Rubicon" is true even though it references an event that happened in history that we do not emperically experience.  No matter what happens in the future of this world or whatever flux happens in matter, nothing is going to change the truthfulness of that proposition.

### Appeal to emotion fallacy

A logical fallacy characterized by the manipulation of the recipient's emotions in order to win an argument, especially in the absence of factual evidence.  Simply put, psychological motivations like emotions have nothing to do with the truth.

### What is worldview apologetics?

A worldview is a set of beliefs or propositions someone holds about the world.  They are the context by which a person reasons and defines evidence or proof, how it is assessed, and how it is applied.  A worldview governs someone's interpretation of all concepts, phenomena, and events (these things are theory-laden).  Thus no one has an epistemically neutral, priviledged, or prior starting position.  Therefore, ultimately it is not a battle of facts because there are no "brute facts", but rather a question of competing paradigms by which we interpret the facts because all facts are theory-laden.

## What is evidential apologetics?

An approach to apologetics emphasizing the use of evidence to demonstrate that God exists.  It's a crappy method because the dispute between the Christian and athiest is not going to be solved by piling up evidences because evidence is going to be interpreted within a paradigm or worldview.  Each person could both look at the same evidence but interpert it completely differently because of their fundamental presuppositions.  No amount of evidence will be convincing if they interpret the evidence a certain way.

## What is the natural theology apologetic?

It can be summed up in Thomas Aquinas's Peripatetic axiom: "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses" adopted from the Peripatetic school of Greek philosophy, established by Aristotle.

**TODO: need to complete**

In response to this David Hume, an empericist skeptic philosopher, basically says if an empericist states "knowledge comes only from sensory experience" and if they are consistant then they can not believe in immaterial transcendentals.  For example, when one sees ball A hit ball B they are not actually seeing "causation" but just 2 events.  Simply put, where in this sense data, under a rock, or in a microscope does one see "causation" itself?  One doesn't therefore none of these transcendentals can be proven emperically.  Thus, extended to the modern age if one is sufficiently skeptical then one can't justify the principles upon which science is based (logic, causality, the scientific method, etc.) because the principles are not emperical and thus can not be justified.  A system built on the Peripatetic axiom inherently collapses because it cannot justify it's claims.

## How to respond to people that say "I am not convinced"?

Reply by saying "That sounds like a you problem, not a me problem." -FrDcnDr. Ananias. Basically, it is not a sufficient reply to the question because it is irrelevent to whether the claim is true or not.  Typically in debate we are dealing with proof, not persuasion.  Whether people accept a proof or not has nothing to do with the validity or soundness of the argument.  For example, if 99% of people do not accept a true statement it does not make it false.

## How to respond to there is no evidence that supports Christianity?

### How are fossils formed?

Fossils are only formed by conditions of rapid burial, not accumulation of sediment materials over thousands of years.  When an animal dies its soft tissue decomposes and is eaten by scavenger animals, insects, and bacteria leaving bones disturbed by this process.  However, even bones erode from natural phenomena like wind, rain, sun, and other thermodynamic effects.  Thus some mechanism is needed to protect the bones from the destructive forces of a terrestrial ecosystem: rapid burial.  After an organism has been buried the organic "soft" materials break down and the inorganic "hard" materials like bone remain, become porous, and get filled with minerals like iron and calcium carbonite.

**NOTE: how long does the process of mineralizing the bones take?  Evolutionists would claim millions of years**

### Immateriality of the Mind Argument

The immateriality of the mind is proven through an argument from the impossibility of the contrary.  A person inherently uses his mind to think through problems and make arguments.  This begs the question then: are thoughts immaterial or material?  An materialist would say that the mind is fundamentally material and thoughts are just an emergent property of cells in the brain.  In the materialist's worldview everything is just the interaction of matter/energy. This then begs further questions: what seperates the matter of the brain from the matter of the photons hitting the retina?  What seperates this from the photons being emitted from a light source or the electrons moving through the filament of that light source, and so on?  They are all equally important and necessary for the materialist's experience of the world.  And yet the materialist gives artificial ownership and importance to his arbitrary set of matter over the entire matter-energy dance of the universe.  If he were to take materialism to its logical conclusion then "he" doesn't actually exist because "he" is just an arbitrary set of material components in an ever-changing deterministic universe.  Any arguments "he" makes aren't actually "his".  In fact the act of argumentation is illusary because fundamentally everything is just matter in motion.  Thus if one were to follow through to the logical conclusions of materialism he would find it is inherently self-refuting.  The only other option then is that thoughts and, by extension other immaterial concepts like the self and others, are immaterial by necessity because we find the contrary to be false.

### Why are numbers and logic immaterial?

- Numbers: If you have seven coconuts and smash one you have not destroyed "sevenness".  Seven particulars is not equal to the universal invariant seven.
- Logic: There are a whole host of mathematical concepts that mathematicians, engineers, and scientists will speak of as discovered and not invented like Mandlebrot sets.  Logic is not contingient on any material thing.
