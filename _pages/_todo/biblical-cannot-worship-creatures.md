# Biblical Cannot Worship Creatures

```
15 “Take careful heed to yourselves, for you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, 16 lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure: the likeness of male or female, 17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air, 18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or the likeness of any fish that is in the water beneath the earth. 19 And take heed, lest you lift your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, you feel driven to worship them and serve them, which the Lord your God has given to all the peoples under the whole heaven as a heritage.
- Deuteronomy 4:15-19 NKJV
```

This is the root of the 10 commandments: that you can't worship creatures and attribute divinity to any created being. Creatures can not become God. Note: icons are not a representation of the Divine Nature, they represent the incarnate Christ.

```
8 Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.

9 Then he said to me, “See that you do not do that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”
- Revelation 22:8-9
```

This angel rebukes John for worshipping him and reminds him to only worship God. Again, you can not worship creatures.
