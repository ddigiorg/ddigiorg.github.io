# Why Not Protestantism

Remember, we cant divorce Christianity from its history so we have to look at the traditions and teachings of the Church in the first millennia to see the true Church.

## Protestantism

Includes:

- Calvinists
- Lutherans
- Evangelicals

The necessities for knowing, believing and being saved are pillars of the Classical Reformation:

- **Sola Scriptura**: (Latin: by scripture alone) is a theological doctrine held by some Christian denominations that the Christian Scriptures are the sole source of authority for Christian faith and practice.
- **Sola Fide**: God's pardon for guilty sinners is granted to and received through faith (in Christ) alone, excluding all "works" (good deeds).
- **Sola Gratia**:
- **Sola Christus**:
- **Sola Deo Gloria**:

## Sola Scriptura (Biblical Canon)

1. Historical Traditions

    - The early Church (pre-Bible) operated on written and oral tradition, not the Scriptures.
    - For many centuries during the time of the Patriarchs (Noah, Abraham, and Moses) information was passed down via oral traditions
    - These oral traditions later becomes codified at the time of Moses.
    - If God can providentially protect the oral traditions for many centuries until Moses then He do it again after the time of the Apostles.
    - The biblical texts themselves include references to extra-canonical traditions (Paul says to the Thessalonians "keep the traditions that you **heard** from me whether oral or written"
    - Some text has been lost to history like letters from Paul that we don't have anymore
    - How do we know that Matthew, the disciple of Christ, wrote the book Matthew?  We don't aside from apostolic tradition passed on through the church.
    - Paul says the pillar of all truth is the one historical Church of God, not written texts

2. Authentic Authorship

    - There was no canon of Scripture in the early Church.
    - It took ~6-7 centuries for the Church to make a rough outline of what documents would be included.
    - Thus the Bible couldn't have been compiled without the historic Church with God's providence.
    - St. John of Damascus's canon was different from the canon of the rest of the Church, but most people don't reject him
    - If you look at the progression of the formation of the canon, you're led to the conclusion for a Protestant that a fallible group of men put together an infallible canon.  This is ultimately contradictory.
    - Continuing in the succession of the Apostles, the early church fathers, bishops, priests, and presbyters also appealed to tradition and what would later be included in the canon of Scripture
    
3. Bible is Liturgical
    
    - The context of Bible is written and meant to be a part of an ordered worship service in the church, not just a private devotional
    - You can't divorce how to interpret and understand the Bible from the life and history of the church

4. From a Protestant point of view, the early Church fathers & saints who compiled the Bible should be considered heretical because they don't teach the solae of the reformation

## Sola Fide

1. Justification by Imputation Alone

    - The doctrine of Sola Fide is based on a presupposition about how to interpret the letters of Paul, particularly book of Romans.
    - The Protestant has to do the mental work of accepting/knowing rationally that his works mean nothing before God and when he does that work he is saved.  This is incoherent.

2. Nestorian Heresy

    - In the case of many of the classical reformers (i.e. John McArthur, Martin Luther, Charles Hodge, John Calvin) the basis for the transaction doctrine of Sola Fide (one's ledger of sins are wiped away) was that the Father damned the Son.  In this view Christ takes the penalty for us.
    - But how is Christ damned if he's the 2nd Person of the God-head?  It's not possible because it would split the Trinity so many Calvanists believe there was a human person Jesus who was damned and that's how we complete this transaction process.
    - Nestorianism: the doctrine that there were two separate persons, one human and one divine, in the incarnate Christ.
    - Nestorius was condemned explicitly at the council of Ephesus
    - When you partake of the Eucarist do you partake of the flesh of some guy or the deified flesh of the God-man?

(NEED TO FINISH 12:06 - 17:14)

3. Regeneration & Noetic Effects

    - Calvinists believe in the noetic effects of sin: a phenomenon in which sin distorts human thinking.
    - When God speaks, His Word is efficacious meaning it comes to be in reality.  Thus when God declares a person righteous He doesn't lie.

## Invisible Church (Denial of Historical Institution)

If the Church is a single entity in the first millennia, then what church matches up to it in the 2nd millennia? For Protestants the "visible church" has divisions, countless sects, and different interpretations but the real spiritual body of Christ, the Church, is invisible.  This is a Nestorian/Gnostic heresy because the visible unity of the Church is just as visible and one as the actual body of Christ.  Christ had a singular unity of physical and spiritual body.  Christ became incarnate in history and had a real physical body

## Liturgical Abolition

## Individual Interpretation

## Ahistorical Lineage

## Heresy Revivals

## Denial of Pentecost
