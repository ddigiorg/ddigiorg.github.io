## Why Not Evidentialist Apologetics

**TODO: need to organize**

Evidential apologetics argues God can be proven by using evidence that both the athiest and thiest share and that one need not presuppose God's existance.  It is based on classical foundationalism, the belief that there must be some infallibly certain starting point like logic, mathematics, etc.  This position inherently rejects circular arguments and is opposed to the coherence theory of justification.  

In this worldview one allows things that are not as certain to be the starting point for what should be more certain.  In other words, if God exists then God is more certain than the laws of logic and abstract principles one is appealing to because He is the ground of those things in the Christian paradigm.  How are you going to use things that He's the ground of as if they were more certain than Him and then say that God's existance is ~98% certain.  So mathematics is more certain than God's existance?  Then logic mathematics is more ultimate... 

Remember, there's never going to be any way to follow through the Peripatetic axiom and justify the things one believes in without appealing to the things one believe in.  Evidentialism therefore is circular and self-refutes the classical foundationalism it's built on.


Simply put, yes we use evidence but we don't put it ahead of the stronger, higher-order, more pressupositional arguments.

Also, evidential apologetics assumes access to an epistemically privilidged position which no one has.
