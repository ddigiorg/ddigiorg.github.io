# Transcendental Argument for the existence of God (TAG)

TAG demonstrates the Christian Triune God as He has revealed Himself to us is only unique precondition that will satisfy all conditions for the possibility of knowledge, logic, rationality, and argumentation.  It is both a presuppositional argument for the Christian worldview and a critique of the presuppositions of other worldviews.




autonomous epistemology vs theonomous epistemology

 “You may recognize this as a simple disjunctive syllogism. Given that knowledge is possible at all, Theonomous 50
Epistemology and Autonomous Epistemology are antithetical systems. One must be true and one must be false. If
one is false, then the other is true. We have seen that, in principle, Autonomous Epistemology is not possible. On
this premise all facts and all experience are unintelligible. Therefore, we must conclude that the precondition to
knowledge, to science, and to philosophy is the existence of God and the veracity of his revelation.” (Russell M.
Manion, “The Contingency of Knowledge and Revelatory Theism.”)







1. Prove the Christian worldview satisfies the conditions of coherence, explainatory power, and justification
2. Prove all other woldviews at the *paradigm-level* are false and thus, by the impossibility of the contrary, the Christian worldview is the only one that is true 



What the TAG demonstrates is that there is only one unique condition that will satisfy the conditions for the
possibility of knowledge, rationality, logic, and arguments. The necessary precondition (what must be
presupposed) in order to have knowledge, logic, and arguments is the Orthodox Christian notion of God as He
has revealed Himself to us (revelation therefore is required since we are unable to get out of the epistemic
quagmire of circularity). In other words, the TAG argues from the impossibility of the contrary. The contrary of
Orthodox Christianity (any view that denies the Orthodox Christian view of God) is shown to be impossible.
And if the negation of Orthodox Christianity is false, then Orthodox Christianity is proved true. That is to say,
the structure of the argument is a disjunctive syllogism. Either A or not-A; not-not-A; therefore A.
Consequently, if TAG establishes that Orthodox Christianity is the necessary conceptual precondition for
rationality, logic, and argumentation, then it follows that we must hold (presuppose) the Orthodox Christian
worldview as it has been revealed to us in order to be rational. Furthermore, if someone refuses to accept the
Orthodox Christian worldview or God’s existence, then they have no foundation for rationality and, without
such a foundation, they have no rational basis for mounting an objection against TAG or the conclusion of
TAG, that the Orthodox notion of God (which is not a generic theistic notion of God, but a personal God unique
only to Orthodoxy, the only condition that satisfies the demands set out) does not exist. Therefore, the God of
Orthodoxy exists.


## Worldviews

- Everyone has a worldview that patterns his or her experiences to make sense of the world.
- A worldview consists of beliefs on ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology
- ultimately all worldviews are circular
- no epistemically neutral position

Terms:

- **Worldview**: a set of beliefs or propositions about the world
- **Ethics**: statements on what is right or wrong
- **Epistemology**: statements on what is true or not true
- **Metaphysics**: statements on what exists and does not exist
- **Coherency**: 
- **Explanatory Power**: the ability of a ___ to explain the subject matter effectively
- **Justification**:

## Types of Proof

- The use of reason, logic, evidence, arguments is not something proven by experience. It is that by which one proceeds to prove everything else.
- crackers in pantry fallacy

## Epistemic Bootstrapping

- since everyone presupposes something (e.g., a precommitment in using logic, reason, evidence, making arguments, etc.), there is no one who is presuppositionally neutral when it comes to factual questions and experience

- However, one nevertheless has to ground and justify that reason, logic, and arguments work and are valid operations for what they think these operations can obtain and establish (this is a meta-logical analysis). The problem is that man, locked within his own sphere of reason, cannot appeal to what is in question (i.e., reason,
logic, and arguments) to establish that reason, logic, and arguments are valid and work. This would be to engage in the fallacy of circular reasoning ("question begging") and epistemic bootstrapping.

- Again, obtaining the necessary conditions for the possibility of knowledge cannot be logically or epistemically contingent upon logical or epistemological arguments, since this would result in question begging and amount to epistemic-bootstrapping.

Neither would the veracity of the claim that such and such conditions are necessary
for the possibility of knowledge (if they are the necessary conditions) be dependent upon logic, arguments, or
syllogistic demonstrations. For what is being sought and identified is not being carried out in a logical or
epistemological analysis, but rather a meta-logical or meta-epistemological analysis. We are seeking the proper
epistemic grounds that would make logic, arguments, syllogisms, and reason possible. Therefore, the necessary
conditions that would provide justification for our knowledge must be both metaphysically and epistemically
prior to epistemology and arguments.

## Transcendental Arguments

- A Transcendental Argument, therefore, attempts to discover the preconditions for the possibility of reason, logic, and argumentation. It does this by taking some aspect of human rationality and investigates what must be true (i.e., the necessary condition) in order for valid rational processes to be possible. Again, as we have seen, transcendental arguments typically have the following form: For x to be the case, y must also be the case, since y is the precondition (or the necessary condition) of x. And given x is the case, y is the case. 

## Why God

For what the history of philosophy and epistemology teaches us is that man isolated within his own sphere reason
and committed to an autonomous epistemology, apart from theistic revelation, cannot justify the existence of
knowledge or establish whether his rational processes are legitimate.50 Tragically, man in his pretended
autonomy and rebellion against God is incapable of knowing “the nature of himself, logic, the world, universals,
or how they all are, or could be, related. In short he cannot attain a coherent theory of knowledge.
Consequently, no beliefs can be justified, and no beliefs can attain to the level of knowledge.”

The solution to our epistemic predicament, which man’s autonomous reason cannot obtain within its own
sphere of reasoning, is a truth that is both personal and obtained through living a life of faith in humility, by
abiding in the only one who is in a position to know the Truth. By uniting one’s self to Christ in this way man
can achieve true knowledge. For since in “the person of the God-man, God and man are indissolubly united,” 54
the gulf between man and truth becomes bridged. Through the theoanthropos our intellects are “renewed,
purified and sanctified… deepened and divinized and made capable of grasping the truths of life in the light of
God-made-man. In the God-man, absolute Truth has in its entirety been given in a real and personal way.”5

Therefore, the only condition that will satisfy the possibility of knowledge and bridge the gulf between man and
truth is the unique idea of God coherently articulated in the theology of the Eastern Orthodox Church who has
preserved the correct doctrine of God received in divine revelation56 from the Holy Trinity. For only in the
Orthodox doctrine of God will we see that God (the necessary condition) is rational, omniscient, transcendent,
non-contingent (necessary), intentional in His creation (as opposed to creation being accidental), a personal and
communal being (having perichoresis within His Trinity), having divine uncreated energies distinct from the
common essence, who becomes incarnate as the God-man (the only one that can bridge the epistemic gap),
sends His Holy Spirit to illumine and solve man's epistemic predicament, and reveals these truths to His
Apostles and set up One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church57 to preserve this revelation unchanged and
handed down to the faithful, not only to solve our epistemic predicament but save us from death and the devil.
These conditions are only to be uniquely found in the Orthodox Church who provides us with a coherent picture
of who God is and how we get to know Him. Furthermore, upon reflection, one will see that without this, we
will be left in the same epistemic predicament as outlined earlier with the various autonomous epistemologies,
and consequently, we will have no justification for the existence of knowledge. Therefore, we must
presuppose58 the God who is “the Lord and has revealed Himself to us”59 as the necessary foundation and
precondition of knowledge in order to possess any knowledge at all. In presupposing God as the necessary
condition for the possibility of knowledge man surrenders his “autonomy to the revelation of God, not as a
conclusion that has met the standards of his epistemological criterion, but as the foundation and precondition of
the epistemological criterion itself. Without a revelation from God, we cannot know that all the objects of the
world are rationally related and that our attributes are appropriate to know it.”60 









### Justifying Knowledge

Humans use faculties like sensation, cognition, logic, reason, arguments, etc. to aquire knowledge about the world.  However, these faculties are also part of the world and are also knowledge about the world.  Thus these faculties can be explored using these faculties



A fundamental question arises: 



- Everyone presupposes something
- This is a meta-level question, "What is the argument for arguments?"
- how do we justify or ground knowledge itself
- sensation vs perception: feedforward sensory data input and feedback perception

Justifying Knowledge with Transcendantals

### Transcendantal Arguments

X is a *necessary condition* for the *possibility* of Y such that Y cannot exist without X

Transcendant objects/concepts, or "transcendentals", are immaterial, invariant, universal, and interrelated concepts that must exist for the possibility of knowledge or predication.  Transcendental arguments involve the claim "X is a necessary condition for the possibility of Y: Y therefore X".  It is more fundamental than other types of claims like "X is Y" (lower order) or "All X are Y" (higher order) such that if one denies any transcendental claim then those less fundamental types of claims are not even possible.  For example, in order to make knowledge claims (lower order) one must have preconditions like the laws of logic, a self, spatio-temporal relationships, words having meaning, etc.  To deny any one of these preconditions would be to deny the possibility of knowledge, the ability to even make claims, and the possibility to experience objects.  This puts the denier in a self-refuting argument or reductio ad absurdum.  Another example, in Aristotle's time the sophists tried to disprove the laws of logic.  However, in attempting to disprove the laws of logic they were using the laws of logic and thus their argument was self refuting.  Immanuel Kant extended this idea by saying if you don't have these transcendental preconditions then you can't even have the possibility of knowledge of any objects in the first place.  Having knowledge of things presupposes a knower (the self), the ability to have knowledge (the mind), the concept of knowledge, and other transcendentals.

transcendental arguments are so fundamental that to deny them is self-refuting


### Triune God

- Grounds, justifies, makes coherent, and explains those interlocking preconditions
- The omnis of God
- Essence/Energy distinction: solves infinite regress problem?
- Logos/Logoi: solves the problem of the one and the many
- Revelation: goedel's incompleteness
- Personal God
- Any coherent system will lead to these conditions

### Impossibility of the Contrary

- not many worldview propositions at the paradigm-level (aka dont have to refute an infinite set of worldviews)

Terms:

- **Disjunctive Syllogism**: Either A or not-A; not-not-A; therefore A

## Common Objections and FAQ

- Why TAG is not affirming the consequent fallacy?
    - this would only apply to modus ponens (ask spacejockey), TAG is not a modus ponens
    - TAG is at the paradigmatic level and is a metaphysical necessary truth
    - Aff Cons: if X then Y; Y; therefore X
    - TAG: X is a *necessary condition* for the *possibility* of Y; Y; therefore X
