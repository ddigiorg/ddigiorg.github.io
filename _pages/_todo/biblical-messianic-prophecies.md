# Biblical Messianic Prophecies

**Typology**: The way the New Testamant treats prophecy is not simply by finding statements that refer to future events or a person to come but by by treating the entire Old Testamant as foreshadowing the future. This method was part and parcel of Jewish interpertive methods that Jesus and the apostles also employed.

## Isaiah 53

```
1 Who has believed our report?
 And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
2 For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant,
 And as a root out of dry ground.
 He has no form or comeliness;
 And when we see Him,
 There is no beauty that we should desire Him.
3 He is despised and rejected by men,
 A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
 And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him;
 He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.

4 Surely He has borne our griefs
 And carried our sorrows;
 Yet we esteemed Him stricken,
 Smitten by God, and afflicted.
5 But He was wounded for our transgressions,
 He was bruised for our iniquities;
 The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,
 And by His stripes we are healed.
6 All we like sheep have gone astray;
 We have turned, every one, to his own way;
 And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.

7 He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
 Yet He opened not His mouth;
 He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,
 And as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
 So He opened not His mouth.
8 He was taken from prison and from judgment,
 And who will declare His generation?
 For He was cut off from the land of the living;
 For the transgressions of My people He was stricken.
9 And they made His grave with the wicked—
 But with the rich at His death,
 Because He had done no violence,
 Nor was any deceit in His mouth.

10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him;
 He has put Him to grief.
 When You make His soul an offering for sin,
 He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days,
 And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.
11 He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied.
 By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many,
 For He shall bear their iniquities.
12 Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great,
 And He shall divide the spoil with the strong,
 Because He poured out His soul unto death,
 And He was numbered with the transgressors,
 And He bore the sin of many,
 And made intercession for the transgressors.

 - Isaiah 53 NKJV
```

Here Isaiah is making a prophecy that details the Servents suffering, bearing the sins of the world, dying a shameful death, being raised up, and exaulted to heaven. Notice that [The Great Isaiah Scroll](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah) is one of the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 AD and is dated around 125 BC.

Note in verse 10:

- an offering for sin: [asham](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/asham_817.htm) is the same word used in Leviticus for the guilt offering

## Isaiah 52:13-15

```
13 Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently;
 He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.
14 Just as many were astonished at you,
 So His visage was marred more than any man,
 And His form more than the sons of men;
15 So shall He sprinkle many nations.
 Kings shall shut their mouths at Him;
 For what had not been told them they shall see,
 And what they had not heard they shall consider.

- Isaiah 52:13-15 NKJV
```

Here Isaiah's prophacy shows the Servant is being exaulted to the Divine state of Yahweh. If the servant was merely a creature, then this would be idolatry and blasphemy because no creature can share in God's unique and soverign enthronement over creation. Note in verse 13 the Servant is:

- exalted: [varum](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/yarum_7311.htm) or "high"
- extolled: [venissa](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/venissa_5375.htm) or "lifted up"

## Isaiah 6:1-5

```
1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. 2 Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one cried to another and said:

“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
The whole earth is full of His glory!”

4 And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.

5 So I said:

“Woe is me, for I am undone!
Because I am a man of unclean lips,
And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;
For my eyes have seen the King,
The Lord of hosts.”

- Isaiah 6:1-5 NKJV
```

Here Isaiah has a vision where he beholds Yahweh in visible glory and visible form. He describes Yahweh's enthronement over creation in the same language that he describes the Servant's exaultation. Note in verse 1:

- Lord: [adonai](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/adonai_136.htm)
- high: [ram](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/ram_7311.htm)
- lifted up: [venissa](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/venissa_5375.htm)

## Isaiah 33:10

```
10 “Now I will rise,” says the Lord; “Now I will be exalted, Now I will lift Myself up.
- Isaiah 33:10 NKJV
```

Jesus rose from the dead, was exaultedm and lifted on high. Note:

- Lord: [yahweh](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/yahweh_3068.htm)
- I will rise: [akum](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/akum_6965.htm)
- I will be exalted: [eromam](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/eromam_7311.htm)
- I will lift Myself up: [ennase](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/ennase_5375.htm)

## Isaiah 57:15

```
15 For thus says the High and Lofty One
 Who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:
 “I dwell in the high and holy place,
 With him who has a contrite and humble spirit,
 To revive the spirit of the humble,
 And to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
- Isaiah 57:15 NKJV
```

Notice ram (high) and nissa (lifted up) again.

## Psalms

David's psalms have the same pattern of the suffering servant found.

## Luke 24:44-46

```
44 Then He said to them, “These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.” 45 And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.

46 Then He said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
- Luke 44:46 NKJV
```

## Romans 5:14

```
14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. 
- Romans 5:14 NKJV
```

Adam was a type of Christ to come. Adam was made in the image of Christ and our Lord's coming wasn't a "plan B" but he was always pre-ordained to become incarnate.

## Matthew 12:39-40

```
39 But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
- Matthew 12:39-40 NKJV
```

Jesus said Jonah was a type of Christ to come.

## John 3:13

```
14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
- John 3:13 NKJV
```

Jesus said Moses lifting up the serpent was a type of Christ to come.

## Hebrews 7:3

```
1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2 to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,” 3 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.
- Hebrews 7:3 NKJV
```

Melchizedek was made like Christ's office of priesthood and character.

## Genesis 37 & Matthew 1:16,19-20

In Genesis 37 God communicated to Joseph in dreams. Joseph's father is Jacob. Joseph has brothers who rejected him and handed him over to the Gentiles (specifically the Egyptians) and he is persecuted. Then he is exaulted and becomes lord of the earth, the savior of the world, and second to pharoah.

In Matthew 1:16 Joseph has a father named Jacob who becomes the adoped father and legal guardian of Jesus. New testemant Joseph recieves dreams and revelations from God as well, see Matthew 1:19-20. Jesus was rejected by his bretheren and handed over to the Gentiles, was persecuted, exaulted to be the savior of the world, and became the lord of all creation second only to the Father in terms of authority.

## Genesis 3

The seed of the woman will crush the head of the serpent. This is why there's a geneology in the Old Testamant from Adam & Eve all the way down to Jesus where Christ fills all 3 offices of prophet, priest, and king. Jesus at the cross fufills the crushing of the head of the serpent.

## Even Adam presignifies Christ and Eve is a type of the Church

```
4 This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, 5 before any plant of the field was in the earth and before any herb of the field had grown. For the Lord God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground; 6 but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.

7 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.
-- Genesis 2:4-7 NKJV
```

The ground from which Adam was created was virgin soil: no man had tilled it and it was empty until the mist arose then God formed Adam's body and breathed into it the breath of life.

```
38 He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.” 39 But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.
-- John 7:38-39 NKJV
```

Water is often a symbol of the Holy Spirit. Our Lord Jesus was concieved from virgin soil by living water, the Holy Spirit, the same breath of life that animated Adam's body. Also we note that when God created Eve he put Adam in a deep sleep and cut his side open and from that Eve came forth. Jesus was put in a deep sleep on the cross and his side was pierced and from it came blood and water which represents the elements which give life to the church, the bride of Christ.

```
41 And it happened, when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 42 Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!
-- Luke 1:41-42 NKJV
```

Even further, you have a virgin in the garden who eats fruit from a forbidden tree and brought death into the world. Mary gives birth to Jesus, the fruit of her womb.

```
30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree.
-- Acts 5:30 NKJV
```

```
39 And we are witnesses of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom [a]they killed by hanging on a tree.
-- Acts 10:39 NKJV
```

```
29 Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.
-- Acts 13:39 NKJV
```

```
13 Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”),
-- Galatians 3:13 NKJV
```

```
24 who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed.
-- 1 Peter 2:24 NKJV
```

We are told that Jesus died on a tree. One virgin eats fruit from a forbidden tree and brings death. Another virgin gives birth to the fruit of her womb. That fruit hangs on a tree who's flesh and blood you must eat and drink in order to be given life. Jesus is the fruit of the tree of life and we eat from that fruit to be given everlasting life.

```
41 Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid. 42 So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews’ Preparation Day, for the tomb was nearby.
-- John 19:41-42 NKJV
```

Death came into the world in a garden. The destruction of death came into the world in a garden. Also note in John 20 a woman,  Mary Magdalen, discovers Jesus and she sees 2 angels. This is a connection with the cherubim of Genesis 3!
