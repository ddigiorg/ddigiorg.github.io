# Why Not Absolute Divine Simplicity

If God is an absolutely simple(all attributes are one, no parts, etc), invisible, spiritual Essence then its a problem to understand how there can be an Incarnation in time and space that doesn't incarnate the whole essence of God.  HOW COULD GOD WALK IN THE GARDEN IF HE DIDNT INCARNATE?  Note also that God had a body before taking on human nature.
