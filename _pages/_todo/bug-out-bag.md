# Bug Out Bag

**TODO: need to consolidate**

I think the key is to have enough basic supplies to wait out the storm and weapons to defend from looters. Canned food, rice, water, and sanitation products like tp and bleach. Being able to harvest food is a trade. Owning guns and rods isn’t enough if you don’t know how to use them
