Have a go bag. Keep it simple - keep it light. Focus on whatâ€™s important: self defense, shelter, fire, water, first aid, and then food, in that order. 

Self defense - a reliable handgun and three mags is best. A knife for when you need to be quiet. A hiking staff gives you a distance advantage in close combat if you cant shoot or dont want to kill. 

Shelter - a tarp and a good sleeping bag is plenty. A tent or hammock are luxury. Have cordage in your kit. 

Fire - have three ways to make fire. A Bic lighter is best...carry a few. A ferro rod is good, weatherproof matches, etc. Know at least one method of primitive fire making. 

Water - filtering and purifying are two different things. Know the difference and know how to do both. Fire making and a vessel to boil water is key. 

First aid - know basic first aid techniques and have a minimal but appropriate first aid kit. Have your medicine backups if you are on prescriptions. 

Food - one can live for a couple weeks without food so focus on the above items first. That said, humping it quickly out of a bad situation will go better if you can give your body calories to perform optimally. Prepackaged, precooked, easily consumed food is best. Energy bars, race food, etc. The more calorie dense the better. 

All the above should fit in a large backpack. Remember to keep it light, mobile. 

This list is also a good place to start your shelter-in-place plans, should that be the correct course of action. Add to it as you see fit. Try to select items that have multiple uses or barter value. 

Speaking of barter, if you really do prep, consider these items as cash will become worthless: 
Ammo, weapons
Cigarettes 
Alcohol
Medicine 
Baby formula, diapers
Toilet paper, wipes
Water, food

If you have a trade or skill, you can also barter that among trusted family friends or neighbors. Speaking of which, your prep plans should include forming an alliance with the above mentioned before the bad event occurs.


This is good advice. Especially...
