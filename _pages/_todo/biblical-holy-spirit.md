# Biblical Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is one Divine person of the Trinity who authored scripture, is creator, sustainer, life-giver, savior, redeemer, and the bestower of gifts of God.

## Early Genesis

```
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
- Genesis 1:2 NKJV
```

Holy Spirit is present at the creation of the world.  Notice the connection between the Spirit and water right at the begining of creation.

## Holy Spirit Spoke Through David

```
1 These are the last words of David:

“The inspired utterance of David son of Jesse,
    the utterance of the man exalted by the Most High,
the man anointed by the God of Jacob,
    the hero of Israel’s songs:

2 “The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me;
    his word was on my tongue.
3 The God of Israel spoke,
    the Rock of Israel said to me:
‘When one rules over people in righteousness,
    when he rules in the fear of God,
- 2 Samuel 23:1-3 NKJV
```

The Holy Spirit spoke through David and instructed him with what to write and he knew this.  For the spirit to speak, teach, and instruct that tells us that the Spirit is a person and the author of scripture using David as His instrument.  In verse 2 it is the Spirit that talked through David.  In verse 3 it says it's the God of Israel who spoke to David.  When the Spirit speaks its God.

## Holy Spirit Inspires Prophets

```
12 Yes, they made their hearts like flint, refusing to hear the law and the words which the Lord of hosts had sent by His Spirit through the former prophets. Thus great wrath came from the Lord of hosts.
- Zechariah 7:12 NKJV
```

Zechariah knows that the former prophets who came before him spoke the words of God by the Spirit.

## God Gives His Spirit to Teach

```
20 You also gave Your good Spirit to instruct them,
   And did not withhold Your manna from their mouth,
   And gave them water for their thirst.
- Nehemiah 9:20 NKJV
```

God have them his good Spirit to teach them and instruct them.  How can Holy Spirit instruct anyone if He is not a person?  Only persons can teach, not some sort of impersonal force.

## Prophets Spoke and Wrote By the Spirit

```
30 Yet for many years You had patience with them,
   And testified against them by Your Spirit in Your prophets.
   Yet they would not listen;
   Therefore You gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
- Nehemiah 9:30 NKJV
```

God sent his Spirit to the prophets to warn Israel.

## Spirit Indwells, Strengthens, and Speaks to Ezekiel

```
24 Then the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet, and spoke with me and said to me: “Go, shut yourself inside your house.
- Ezekiel 3:24 NKJV
```

```
5 Then the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me, “Speak! ‘Thus says the Lord: “Thus you have said, O house of Israel; for I know the things that come into your mind.
- Ezekiel 11:5 NKJV
```

How does an impersonal "force" speak and tell the prophet what to say and write down?

## More Examples in Micah

```
7 You who are named the house of Jacob:
  “Is the Spirit of the Lord restricted?
  Are these His doings?
  Do not My words do good
  To him who walks uprightly?
- Micah 2:7 NKJV
```

```
8 But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord,
  And of justice and might,
  To declare to Jacob his transgression
  And to Israel his sin.
- Micah 3:8
```

Micah is saying the Spirit empowers him to preach God's word without compromise.

## Holy Spirit is Grieved (Personal) and has the "Omnis"

```
10 But they rebelled and grieved His Holy Spirit;
   So He turned Himself against them as an enemy,
   And He fought against them.
- Isaiah 63:10 NKJV
```

How can Israel grieve an impersonal force?  The Holy Spirit is a person with Divine emotions.  Notice "His Holy Spirit" which is 2 distinct persons.

## Holy Spirit is Trinity and has Attributes and Actions of God

```
11 Then he remembered the days of old,
   Moses and his people, saying:
   “Where is He who brought them up out of the sea
   With the shepherd of His flock?
   Where is He who put His Holy Spirit within them,
- Isaiah 63:11 NKJV
```

```
14 As a beast goes down into the valley,
   And the Spirit of the Lord causes him to rest,
   So You lead Your people,
   To make Yourself a glorious name.
- Isaiah 63:14 NKJV
```

```
14 And He said, “My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
15 Then he said to Him, “If Your Presence does not go with us, do not bring us up from here.
- Exodus 33:14-15 NKJV
```

```
28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
- Matthew 11:28 NKJV
```

Isaiah is saying at the time of Moses God placed his Holy Spirit in the midst of Israel, His people.  Why did God do this?  To guide them, make the holy, and sustain them.  What kind of attributes must He have to do this to thousands of people?  A personal relationship and the omnis.  Notice in Exodus that God gave Moses and the people rest but in Isaih 14 it was the Spirit who gave them rest.  Who did it then?  Both together in perfect unity give rest to the people of God.  Notice also in Matthew Jesus gives them rest.  Wait... both Jesus, Yahweh, and The Spirit give rest to everyone (all) no matter how many and who they are!

## Holy Spirit has the "Omnis"

```
25 Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. 26 I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. 27 I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.
- Ezekiel 36:25-27 NKJV
```

What kind of attributes must the Holy Spirit have to indwell an entire nation of people in different places and enable them to obey God?
- omniscient: He has to know people's hearts
- omnipresence: He has to be present everywhere
- omnipotence: He has to be powerful enough to change everyone's hearts

This is also a messianic prophecy.

## God Gives Life by the Holy Spirit

```
12 Therefore prophesy and say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord God: “Behold, O My people, I will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves, and bring you into the land of Israel. 13 Then you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your graves, O My people, and brought you up from your graves. 14 I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land. Then you shall know that I, the Lord, have spoken it and performed it,” says the Lord.’ ”
- Ezekiel 37:12-14 NKJV
```

What kind of attributes must the Holy Spirit have to take an entire nation of dead people and make them alive spiritualy and physically?  The omnis.  Ezekiel knew the Spirit could speak to him, indwelled him, instructed him what to say, gives life, recreates and sustains.

## Holy Spirit is Creator, Life-Giver, and Sustainer

```
29 You hide Your face, they are troubled;
You take away their breath, they die and return to their dust.
30 You send forth Your Spirit, they are created;
And You renew the face of the earth.
- Psalm 104:29-30 NKJV
```

Holy Spirit is creator, life-giver, re-creator, ressurrector, replenisher, rejuvenator.  When God is upset with sinners he takes away their spirit, they die and return to the dust.  But if He wants to give them life again and recreate them He sends His Spirit who ressurrects them an renews the entire face of the earth.  What attributes does the Spirit have to have to do this?  The omnis.  Note: this is cross-referenced in Job 34 (see below).

## David Knows the Holy Spirit Sustains Him

```
10 Teach me to do Your will,
For You are my God;
Your Spirit is good.
Lead me in the land of uprightness.
- Psalm 143:10 NKJV
```

```
10 Create in me a clean heart, O God,
And renew a steadfast spirit within me.
11 Do not cast me away from Your presence,
And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.
- Psalm 51:10-11 NKJV
```

David knows its His good Spirit that leads him and sustains him to live the Godly life.  This is why when David commited adultery and murdered Uriah he begs God not to take away the Holy Spirit from him.

## Holy Spirit is Omnipresent

```
7 Where can I go from Your Spirit?
Or where can I flee from Your presence?
8 If I ascend into heaven, You are there;
If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.
9 If I take the wings of the morning,
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
10 Even there Your hand shall lead me,
And Your right hand shall hold me.
11 If I say, “Surely the darkness shall fall on me,”
Even the night shall be light about me;
12 Indeed, the darkness shall not hide from You,
But the night shines as the day;
The darkness and the light are both alike to You.
- Psalm 139:7-12 NKJV
```

David knows God's Spirit is present everywhere, aka omnipresent.  Notice he says I can not flee from "Your Spirit" and "Your presence".  That's two distinct persons but no matter where David goes, both will be there.

## Holy Spirit is Omniscient

```
13 Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord,
Or as His counselor has taught Him?
14 With whom did He take counsel, and who instructed Him,
And taught Him in the path of justice?
Who taught Him knowledge,
And showed Him the way of understanding?
- Isaiah 40:13-14 NKJV
```

Isaiah is saying can there be anyone who can counsel, guide, teach, instruct the Holy Spirit?  No.  How can you teach someone who knows everything and is infinitly wise?  You can't because the Holy Spirit is omniscient.  Notice again this the Spirit of the Lord, 2 distinct persons but one in essense.

## The Spirit is Creator, Life-Giver, Sustainer, etc.

```
4 The Spirit of God has made me,
  And the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
- Job 33:4 NKJV
```

```
3 As long as my breath is in me,
  And the breath of God in my nostrils,
- Job 27:3 NKJV
```

```
8 But there is a spirit in man,
  And the breath of the Almighty gives him understanding.
- Job 32:8 NKJV
```

```
14 If He should set His heart on it,
   If He should gather to Himself His Spirit and His breath,
15 All flesh would perish together,
   And man would return to dust.
- Job 34:14-15 NKJV
```

Job knows that The Spirit of God is the one who made man and sustains his spirit (breath of life) and gives understanding/insight regarding who God is.  God and His Spirit can also take away your spirit when it is time for you to die.  This is cross-referenced in Psalm 104:29-30 (see above).

```
13 By His Spirit He adorned the heavens;
   His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
- Job 26:14 NKJV
```

Job says God used His Spirit to create the heavens.

## The Spirit Sustains the Earth and Replenishes Creation

```
14 Because the palaces will be forsaken,
   The bustling city will be deserted.
   The forts and towers will become lairs forever,
   A joy of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks—
15 Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high,
   And the wilderness becomes a fruitful field,
   And the fruitful field is counted as a forest.
- Isaiah 32:14-15 NKJV
```

This specific city is going to be a desert until the Spirit is poured upon us then it will be a forest.  When God wants to replenish a parched land and a dead people He pours out the Spirit Who gives live.

```
16 “Search from the book of the Lord, and read:
   Not one of these shall fail;
   Not one shall lack her mate.
   For My mouth has commanded it, and His Spirit has gathered them.
- Isaiah 34:16 NKJV
```

This verse is saying none of these people shall die but they will be taken care of by God's Spirit.  What kind of attributes must He have to sustain and preserve an entire people simultaneously?  The omnis.

```
1 “Yet hear now, O Jacob My servant,
  And Israel whom I have chosen.
2 Thus says the Lord who made you
  And formed you from the womb, who will help you:
  ‘Fear not, O Jacob My servant;
  And you, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.
3 For I will pour water on him who is thirsty,
  And floods on the dry ground;
  I will pour My Spirit on your descendants,
  And My blessing on your offspring;
- Isaiah 44:1-3 NKJV
```

Notice another connection with water and Spirit.  Water replenishes, rejuvenates, and gives life.  Water is poured out and gives life to the ground while the Spirit is poured out and gives life to man.

```
19 So shall they fear
The name of the Lord from the west,
And His glory from the rising of the sun;
When the enemy comes in like a flood,
The Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against him.

20 “The Redeemer will come to Zion,
And to those who turn from transgression in Jacob,”
Says the Lord.

21 “As for Me,” says the Lord, “this is My covenant with them: My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth, nor from the mouth of your descendants, nor from the mouth of your descendants’ descendants,” says the Lord, “from this time and forevermore.”
- Isaiah 59:19-21 NKJV
```

The Spirit of the Lord will fight for the people of God in verse 19.  God also promises to give them His Spirit to remain on them permanently to sustain and preserve them so they will never sin against Him again.  This is the new creation, regeneration brought by the Spirit of God when the Redeemer comes, Jesus Christ.
