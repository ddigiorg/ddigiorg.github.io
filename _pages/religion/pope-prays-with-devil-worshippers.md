- Pope visited Iraqi ziggarat and holds an inter-religious prayer [^1]
- "The inter-religious prayer service will be attended by Christians, Muslims, Mandaean-Sabaean, Yazidi and other religious minorities present in Iraq." [^1]
- The yazidis worship "melek taus" who is also called "shaytan" (satan) [^2]
- "Matters become more challenging because Melek Taus is also called, or at least was once called, “Shaytan,” the same name for Satan used in the Islamic Quran. That Melek Taus is, for the Yazidi, the deputy ruler of the world has caused them to be accused of devil worship." [^3]
- “In those stars he saw the promise of his descendants — he saw us,” said Francis, surrounded by Muslim and Christian leaders and representatives of ancient religious minorities. Francis also spoke of injustice and the dispossessed [^4]. Supposedly all these religions are the promise of Abraham... No, according to Galatians and Romans, it's Christians.  Paul has multiple letters making this clear. Francis telling us the promis is to muslims and anti-trinitarians... no.
- Also, John Paul II organized Assisi I and II in the 80s where world religions come together for generic "prayer meetings" [^5]
- **Mortalium Animos**: Pope Pius XI encyclical 1928 that states interfaith gatherings are apostacy [^6]
- thus how within a few decades does it become "the work of the Holy Spirit"?

Other instances

- God wills all the other religions statement together with the Imam
- Pachamama: human sacrifice idol blessed in the vatican
- Amazon synod
- frateli tutti with prayers for all the world religions including non-trinitarians... unitarian prayers in the encyclical
- molech statue the vatican approved at the coleseum museum

Thesis: In roman catholic theology you cant be a roman catholic in good standing and do those kinds of actions.  Those actions in catholic moral theology are considered apostasy.  Apostasy in canon law removes a person from the Body of Christ

To reject the catholic faith in any dogma including sins of heresy, schism, and apostasy removes you from the Body of Christ
  - mystici corporus
  - satis cognitum

how can the pope be a head of which he is not a member?

Vatican I has removed the possibility of having a heretical pope.  That opinion is no longer possible in the RC church so you have to follow Francis, you cant pick and choose his magisterial and ordinary teaching
