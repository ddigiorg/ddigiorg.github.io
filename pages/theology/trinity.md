# Trinity

- **Theophany**: A Divine manifestation in time and space.
- **Angel**: [malachim](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/malachim_4397.htm). Messenger. Could be a Divine or creature (human or spiritual).
- It is forbidden to worship creatures (see 10 commandments), but clearly the Theophanies are worshiped.
- **Doctrine of Perichoresis**: Perichoresis is the Greek word for indwelling. Each of the 3 Persons of God are distinct and indwelling one another. Even though the persons are distinct and share the same nature, they also indwell one another.

```
And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
- Genesis 1:2 NKJV
```

Holy Spirit is present at the creation of the world.

```
26 Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness...
- Genesis 1:26 NKJV
```

- [naaseh](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/naaseh_6213.htm): let Us make
- [betzalmenu](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/betzalmenu_6754.htm): in Our image
- [kidmutenu](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/kidmutenu_1823.htm): according to Our likeness

```
8 And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden.
- Genesis 3:8 NKJV
```

This is one of the first Theophanies that is explicit in scripture. Although we don't know what the metaphysical experience of Eden was like, but we know Adam and Eve existed as beings created by God and had a direct relationship with God. They saw this manifestation of God and interacted with Him.

```
10 Then the Angel of the Lord said to her, “I will multiply your descendants exceedingly, so that they shall not be counted for multitude.”
- Genesis 15:10 NKJV

13 Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees; for she said, “Have I also here seen Him who sees me?” 14 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi; observe, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
- Genesis 16:13-14 NKJV
```

This Angel of the Lord interacts with Hagar and is identified here as God.

```
18 Then the Lord appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. 2 So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, 3 and said, “My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant.
- Genesis 18:1-3 NKJV
```

In Genesis 18 and 19 The Lord appears with two angels within time and space and Abraham eats with God.

```
5 Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.”
- Exodus 3:5 NKJV

14 And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ”
- Exodus 3:14 NKJV
```

Moses takes off his shoes because he's on holy ground and meets "I AM WHO AM", the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: Yahweh.

```
20 “Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name is in Him.
- Genesis 23:20-21 NKJV
```

Two persons are present here. Is the name of God, Yahweh, the eternally existing One, in a creature? No. This Angel of the Lord is the same Angel that's present in Exodus 3:14.

```
18 And he said, “Please, show me Your glory.”

19 Then He said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.” 20 But He said, “You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live.” 21 And the Lord said, “Here is a place by Me, and you shall stand on the rock. 22 So it shall be, while My glory passes by, that I will put you in the cleft of the rock, and will cover you with My hand while I pass by. 23 Then I will take away My hand, and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”
- Exodus 33:18-23 NKJV
```

In Exodus 33 Moses asks to see God's face. Notice that God says Moses cannot see His face, His glory, and live. However God shows Moses a **different attribute**, His **goodness**. St. Paul explains this text in 2 Corinthians 3 (written 55-56 AD). He said if Moses saw God and still had to veil his face, then it's more powerful with us that we see Christ face-to-face, our God. Arianism is dumb lol.

```
15 “Take careful heed to yourselves, for you saw no form when the Lord spoke to you at Horeb out of the midst of the fire, 16 lest you act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved image in the form of any figure: the likeness of male or female, 17 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth or the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the air, 18 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground or the likeness of any fish that is in the water beneath the earth. 19 And take heed, lest you lift your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, the moon, and the stars, all the host of heaven, you feel driven to worship them and serve them, which the Lord your God has given to all the peoples under the whole heaven as a heritage.
- Deuteronomy 4:15-19 NKJV
```

This is the root of the 10 commandments: that you can't worship creatures and attribute divinity to any created being. Creatures can not become God. Note: icons are not a representation of the Divine Nature, they represent the incarnate Christ.

```
8 Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.

9 Then he said to me, “See that you do not do that. For I am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God.”
- Revelation 22:8-9
```

This angel rebukes John for worshipping him and reminds him to only worship God. Again, you can not worship creatures.

```
13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, a Man stood opposite him with His sword drawn in His hand. And Joshua went to Him and said to Him, “Are You for us or for our adversaries?”

14 So He said, “No, but as Commander of the army of the Lord I have now come.”

And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and worshiped, and said to Him, “What does my Lord say to His servant?”

15 Then the Commander of the Lord’s army said to Joshua, “Take your sandal off your foot, for the place where you stand is holy.” And Joshua did so.
- Joshua 5:13-15 NKJV
```

Here the Commander of the Lord's Army is worshiped. Remember, you can not worship creatures. Notice He tells Joshua to take his shoes off because the place is holy, just like Exodus 3:5 when God spoke to Moses. This is the Son of God.

```
 9 “I watched till thrones were put in place,
   And the Ancient of Days was seated;
   His garment was white as snow,
   And the hair of His head was like pure wool.
   His throne was a fiery flame,
   Its wheels a burning fire;
10 A fiery stream issued
   And came forth from before Him.
   A thousand thousands ministered to Him;
   Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him.
   The court was seated,
   And the books were opened.

...
 
13 “I was watching in the night visions,
   And behold, One like the Son of Man,
   Coming with the clouds of heaven!
   He came to the Ancient of Days,
   And they brought Him near before Him.
14 Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom,
   That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him.
   His dominion is an everlasting dominion,
   Which shall not pass away,
   And His kingdom the one
   Which shall not be destroyed.

- Daniel 7:9-10,13-14 NKJV
```

The Ancient of Days is a representation of the Father. The Son of Man ascends with a cloud to the Ancient of Days and given His throne and possessions. This is what happens in Acts 1 when Jesus is resurrected and ascends with a cloud to the heavens and is seated at the right hand of the Father from which he reigns now in the church. This text is a prophecy that the Son of Man is going to be resurrected, ascend into heaven, and given dominion from a **seperate** Divine personage, the Ancient of Days.

```
26 And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it. 27 Also from the appearance of His waist and upward I saw, as it were, the color of amber with the appearance of fire all around within it; and from the appearance of His waist and downward I saw, as it were, the appearance of fire with brightness all around. 28 Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.
- Ezekiel 1:26-28 NKJV
```

Ezekiel 1 in totality is pretty based. This cherubim is a living-being chariot and the Son of Man is here on His awesome chariot throne.  Notice it says "this was the appearance of the **likeness** of the glory of the Lord." Notice in Revelation that John describes Jesus in exactly this way and the exact same symbolic description in Daniel 7.

```
1 And I looked, and there in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim, there appeared something like a sapphire stone, having the appearance of the likeness of a throne. 2 Then He spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, “Go in among the wheels, under the cherub, fill your hands with coals of fire from among the cherubim, and scatter them over the city.” And he went in as I watched.

3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. 4 Then the glory of the Lord went up from the cherub, and paused over the threshold of the temple; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the Lord’s glory. 5 And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard even in the outer court, like the voice of Almighty God when He speaks.
- Ezekiel 10:1-5 NKJV
```

Notice here another Theophany, a Man that spoke. This person is the glory of the Lord, one like the Son of Man, the Angel of the Lord. When He speaks it's the Word of God.

```
16 And the Angel of the Lord said to Manoah, “Though you detain Me, I will not eat your food. But if you offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the Lord.” (For Manoah did not know He was the Angel of the Lord.)

17 Then Manoah said to the Angel of the Lord, “What is Your name, that when Your words come to pass we may honor You?”

18 And the Angel of the Lord said to him, “Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?”

19 So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it upon the rock to the Lord. And He did a wondrous thing while Manoah and his wife looked on— 20 it happened as the flame went up toward heaven from the altar—the Angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar! When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell on their faces to the ground. 21 When the Angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and his wife, then Manoah knew that He was the Angel of the Lord.

22 And Manoah said to his wife, “We shall surely die, because we have seen God!”

23 But his wife said to him, “If the Lord had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering...
- Judges 13:16-22 NKJV
```

Here Manoah and his wife identify the Angel of the Lord as God who accepted the burnt goat offering. This is a pre-incarnate manifestation of Christ.

```
41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them, 42 saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose Son is He?”

They said to Him, “The Son of David.”

43 He said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord,’ saying:

44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
“Sit at My right hand,
Till I make Your enemies Your footstool” ’?

45 If David then calls Him ‘Lord,’ how is He his Son?” 46 And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor from that day on did anyone dare question Him anymore.
- Matthew 22:41-45 NKJV
```

The trinity is present in this section because Jesus is refuting the pharisees by saying "why does David call the messiah Lord?".

```
 1 Why do the nations rage,
   And the people plot a vain thing?
 2 The kings of the earth set themselves,
   And the rulers take counsel together,
   Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,
 3 “Let us break Their bonds in pieces
   And cast away Their cords from us.”

 4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh;
   The Lord shall hold them in derision.
 5 Then He shall speak to them in His wrath,
   And distress them in His deep displeasure:
 6 “Yet I have set My King
   On My holy hill of Zion.”

 7 “I will declare the decree:
   The Lord has said to Me,
   ‘You are My Son,
   Today I have begotten You.
 8 Ask of Me, and I will give You
   The nations for Your inheritance,
   And the ends of the earth for Your possession.
 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron;
   You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel.’ ”

10 Now therefore, be wise, O kings;
   Be instructed, you judges of the earth.
11 Serve the Lord with fear,
   And rejoice with trembling.
12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry,
   And you perish in the way,
   When His wrath is kindled but a little.
   Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.
- Psalm 2 NKJV
```

This is a reference to Christ. David is given these things in material history but also Christ prophesying in the Spirit. Notice "You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.". The Angel of the Lord did not come to exist when Mary gave birth. The eternally existing Ancient of Days did not come to be at the foundation of the world, he is the everlasting Father and the eternal Son.

```
6 For unto us a Child is born,
  Unto us a Son is given;
  And the government will be upon His shoulder.
  And His name will be called
  Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God,
  Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
7 Of the increase of His government and peace
  There will be no end,
  Upon the throne of David and over His kingdom,
  To order it and establish it with judgment and justice
  From that time forward, even forever.
  The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.
- Isaiah 9:6-7 NKJV
```

This is a messianic prophecy about Christ: the eternal Divine person, Angel of the Lord, messenger of the covenant, identical in power and glory to the Ancient of Days. Notice "his name will be called **Wonderful**" just like in Judges 13:18 when speaking to Manoah.

```
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God. 3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.
- John 1:1-5 NKJV
```

This is a recapitulation of Genesis 1, the first creation. John is speaking here of the new creation: the kingdom of God and of Christ, the resurrection, the new Jeruselem, etc. Here it is stated that Jesus was always in the beginning with the Father. God the Father has eternally spoken the Son. The light/darkness in Genesis 1 was talking about created light/darkness.  Here it is talking about spiritual light/darkness. The rest of John 1 contains more on the eternal Christ.

```
16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.
- John 1:16-18 NKJV
```

Exactly what we've seen in the Old Testament.

CHECK OUT ZACHARAIAH IN MY ORTHODOX STUDY BIBLE: HAS TRINITY

```
1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. 2 Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one cried to another and said:

“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
The whole earth is full of His glory!”
- Isaiah 6:1-3 NKJV
```

Notice here Isaiah **sees** the Lord, didn't die, and is sitting on a throne.

Other notes:

- If God is an absolutely simple(all attributes are one, no parts, etc), invisible, spiritual Essence then its a problem to understand how there can be an Incarnation in time and space that doesn't incarnate the whole essence of God.  HOW COULD GOD WALK IN THE GARDEN IF HE DIDNT INCARNATE?  Note also that God had a body before taking on human nature. [1] (throw this in ADS vs EE section)
