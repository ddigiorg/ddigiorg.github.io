# Why Not Atheism?

## Transcendental Argument

- Strongest argument for God's existence because it shows the necessity of God's existence in a logical framework.
- Transcendental categories: things not known or proven through mere sense experience that are assumed for the possibility of knowledge at all (see Transcendental Argument topic)
- To deny any of these transcendentals you would negate the possibility of knowledge, cognition, reasoning, etc.
- Transcendentals are necessary for a worldview
- One can deny any of these and still have a worldview, but at that point they're being inconsistent & incoherent
- When we bundle all these necessary transcendentals together to justify one another, how do we justify this giant web?  The Divine Mind.
- The Divine Mind is the basis for these things and we can show this logically and show worldviews without this end up in relativism, contradiction, and self-refutation at a very fundamental level
- In short it shows that reasoning itself presupposes the Christian God.
- It's impossible to live your life as if "the good" is purely subjective
- Even such basic philosophical assumptions like whether there's an external world ultimately cannot be justified unless you have a world grounded in an external being like the Mind of God and not in our own subjective experience

## Naive Empiricism

- We utilize these abstract concepts like meaning, logic, math, love, beauty, aesthetics, telos, etc. are assumed but not empirically demonstrated
- We assume our senses match up to the external world.  Can we empirically verify that claim? No.
- Most atheists are naive empiricists: we only know what's true from sense experience.  We cannot prove that claim itself from sense experience so at a fundamental level it's contradictory.
- Beauty relates to form and symmetry
- Mathematics is discovered, not a human invention (i.e. Mandelbrot set) which shows mathematical concepts exist outside our mind

## Nihilism

- Nihilism is the end result of atheism
- Modern atheism since the enlightenment is just a flavor of revolutionary thought
- Epistemological self consciousnesses: over time becoming more consistent with your governing presuppositions
- Enlightenment/Scientific Revolution caused the rise of rationalism and universal enlightenment ideals which in a few centuries devolves into postmodernism and into will-to-power Nietzsche ideas into full Nihilism
- Even though "stage 1" atheism might not be nihilistic, if you're consistent the end result is nihilistic because there's not really any reason for anything
- Nihilism there's no reason to do X over Y and in effect all actions are perfectly equalized and it doesn't matter what happens... it just is
- Hume: you cant get an ought from an is, you cant get a standard/objective/value judgment from a mere is.  Just because something is the case doesn't lead to you ought to do this or believe that
- Atheism/materialism cannot provide any objective standard of ethics
- Well you have to be nice to people.  Why?  The natural world is full of predator/prey relations... why not harm people.  There's no reason for anything.  Events just are.
- Your own conciseness is just a series of chemical reactions and there's nothing that underlines them or gives them meaning... they just are

## Social Engineering

- Atheism is part of a larger social engineering tool and is promoted by very powerful & wealthy people not just because people want what's noble or true but actually to take society in a certain direction
- Studying the history of revolutionary movements you'll learn about worldviews and ideologies being weaponized (ie CIA using ideologies in Cold War era)
- Atheism & its worldviews have been used as psychological warfare tools
- Modern day atheists are being propped up by the system/establishment which is why they all tout the establishment line.  They all across the board wind up talking about the "normie" takes on everything.  (Tyson, Bill Nye, Micheal Shermer, etc).  Establishment pop mouthpieces.
- Atheist thinkers/writers are bing supported by the system to take us in a particular direction
- See Jay's Globalist Book Series

## Pragmatism

- Do atheist societies "work"?  This is conditioned on your presuppositions/assumptions themselves because by what metric do we evaluate "work".  If these presuppositions are false then it will lead you to incorrect conclusions.
- For example, if I think depopulation is "good" then getting rid of lots of people via mass death "works"
- Problem of pragmatism: It assumes an objective standard while at the same time denying objective standards.  That's incoherent.
- For example, if we want to protect x,y,z and not protect a,b,c then there's really no objective reason why we should or should not (domain of ethics) do as such because in this worldview there's no coherent basis for objective ethics
- Most modern atheism comes out of the tradition of David Hume (classic skeptic) and the denial of metaphysics (and concrete metaphysical principles).  This position boxes yourself in to a position of subjectivity if you are being coherent.
- This position is actually personal preference rather than brute pragmatism because it's completely arbitrary and ad-hoc because there's no underlying basis or reason to hold the position
- Atheism ultimately boils down to subjectivism and not able to be grounded in objective principles because atheism is grounded in a movement against objective metaphysical principles

## Anti-humanism

- Atheist thinkers tend to have a dialectical tension between humanism vs. anti-humanism
- History of depopulation movement, Rockefeller foundation, communist regimes, and utopian systems are disastrous and anti-human
- When you have a system where man is not made in the image of God then all human rights are meaningless because you're not held to an objective standard because all standards are relative
- Atheism is the dehumanization of man and the globalist elite believe that and foster atheism to demoralize population so they are more malleable to social engineering: soy wars, video games, sports, other idols from the system to make you feel like a male (synthetic masculinity) rather than being grounded in a coherent worldview

## Materialism

- Atheism tends to be extremely materialistic (minus the solypsists or "simulation" believers)
- Atheism cant account for the senses matching up to the external world because you cant know/prove there's an external world (David Hume)(Two Dogmas of Empiricism)
- A materialist philosophy puts one in a box that undermines philosophy and knowledge at all
- If all that exists is matter then not only can you not know that because it's a metaphysical universal claim but also you cant ultimately know that the external world is not just a projection of your on psyche
- If we're just basing the world on our sense-data all we have is impressions of our experiences and not direct access to what's actually out there (Kant Ding an sich or thing-in-itself).  We only know the phenomenal experiences that we have so its possible that all those external sense impressions we experience are just mental phantasms.  If they're just mental phantasms then we don't actually know if there's an external world because we cant empirically demonstrate that.
- Ashiest take what we would say is in the Mind of God and smush that into the mind of man and ultimately man tries to take on the role of God.  Ultimately they still believe in God because they use the attributes and necessities of God but they all place that in the mind of finite meaningless man.

## Meaninglessness

- Man is a bag of cells and chemical reactions in an infinite vast universe of meaninglessness doing meaningless things and then turns to meaningless dust
- Your words, conscience, etc are just meaningless chemical reactions
- Yet the atheist spends his days fighting theism... but it's all meaningless so why even care about people being "suppressed" or "superstition"?  Why care about being noble, fighting for what's rational, being logical?  Its a giant meaningless universe so those things are all meaningless.
- If it's all ultimately meaningless then the atheist's words and argument are ultimately meaningless.  This is incoherent on their position.
- If God exists then there are metaphysical principles, ethical absolutes, and knowledge and certitude.  There is regularity in nature because of Divine Providence

## Assumptions

- Atheism assumes standards like morals and absolutes.  It assumes the things that are necessary to refute Christianity (that only make sense in a Christian worldview) to try to argue against it.  It's like sitting on a limb of a tree and sawing the limb off
- Example: Ludwig Wittgenstein said all language is just word games and trickery and if you deconstruct all language it is meaningless.  But he wrote a book... with words... he used words to convince you that words are meaningless
- Atheism winds up in incoherence at a fundamental level

## Outlandish Claims

- Relies on miracles and postulations, not empirical evidence
- Example: knowing there was a past and claims about what happened aeons ago... what the monkey was doing 11 million years ago in Africa... no one has observed this
- these outlandish claims are usually argued for on the basis of authority
- You cant prove the self... it is assumed in every argument the atheist uses
- You cant prove meaning and yet the atheist argues that the world is ultimately meaningless as he utilizes words to argue against words and meaning
- You cant know or prove the past (its a transcendental category) but yet these things are magically believed to exist and to have occurred
- The whole universe coming out of nothing for no reason... life/conscientiousness came from nothing... this is a secular miracle
